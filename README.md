# Advectioon Scheme

This project is a Python script for comparing between basic and alternative 
schemes in Linear Advection and do some experiments.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the code:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `math`

## Step
- Clone those repository to your local machine.
- Put file Schemes.py in the same folder with other files
- Execute the code in file advectionequation_simple.py using Python 3.x to create the results for Basic and Alternative Schemes
- Execute the code in file Conservation.py using Python 3.x to create the experiment result of conservaation 
- Execute the code in file test_order_simplever.py using Python 3.x to create the experiment result order of convergence 
- Execute the code in file TV_simple.py using Python 3.x to create the experiment result of total variation.
  
## Results:
- The code file advectionequation_simple.py will produce output and visualizations of basic and alternative schemes and their errors.
- The code file Conservation.py will produce output and visualizations of conservation experiment.
- The code file test_order_simplever.py will produce output and visualizations of order convergence experiment.
- The code file TV.py will produce output and visualizations of total variation experiment.
